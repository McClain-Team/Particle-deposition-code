Trial Number Note: 
This experiment was conducted in sets of 10 trials. Some data has trial numbers 11-20 or 21-30. 
This is because a set of trials was conducted earlier, but not included for data analysis. 
Reason for exclusion from data analysis include issues with power supply, insufficent isolation from airflow, and changing the time of deposition.
